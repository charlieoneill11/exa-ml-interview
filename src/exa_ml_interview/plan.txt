Load data into train and test

Define and train bi-encoder model

Embed the corpus

Select 1000 random queries from dev and evaluate
* Record average time from each

If time is not a problem, see if we can improve this:
* 

If time is a problem, reduce latency:
* Cluster nearest neighbours and implement search
* TF-IDF index - keyword search first
* Quantise
